However, the financial technology (fintech) sector has helped to eliminate many of these complexities and made the customer experience seamless in various ways.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Establishing an exceptional customer experience isn''t achieved by simply concentrating on improving the digital components that a service or product needs in this day and age.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Aside from web-based solutions, there are also other crucial factors that need to be considered, such as reliable customer service, immediate processing of transactions, and consistent communication. Clearly, the fintech sector doesn''t want to be limited to web designing, instead, their goal is to contribute to a broader aspect of business solutions.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Read on and you can find more here about the critical ways that fintech is redefining customer experience.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>1. Seamless and responsive digital UX</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Customer experience today has evolved digitally. Nowadays, customers don''t only define their experience with financial institutions by what happens in the bank.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Besides physical interactions, digital interactions have extended the borders of customer relationships. Thus, customers can define their experience with financial institutions based on the quality of their digital experience.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>FinTech is redefining customer relationships by creating a seamless and responsive digital user experience for customers.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Applications have been enhanced, enabling customers to interact with financial institutions via smartphones and tablets. Website designs have evolved to be more responsive and engaging in digital platforms. These innovations have greatly improved customers'' digital user experience (UX).</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>2. Improving financial data interpretation</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Almost all the data produced by financial institutions don''t come in forms that make them quickly understood. From numerical tallies to graphs and pie charts, many customers find reading financial data boring and pointless, due to the fact that they can''t comprehend any detail on it. As a result, they don''t get any relevant information that they need in the data presented to them.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>FinTech has worked towards overcoming this challenge by improving the face and nature of data. Financial institutions have gotten more creative in their presentation. With colorful dashboards and reports becoming interactive and engaging, customers are now able to comprehend more data than they ever did before. In short, financial data has become insightful and actionable, with the help of financial technology.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>3. Transforming customer communications through artificial intelligence</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform customer communications is making more financial institutions adopt it as their strategy for self-service. It has also proved helpful in helping banking executives navigate the digital space.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>For a long time, AI has been seen as a futuristic innovation. FinTech has proved this accurate by utilising chatbots and predictive analysis to improve customer communication.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>AI technology enables instantaneous mobile interactions that allow financial institutions to perform their daily tasks effectively. In addition, AI services grant customers the opportunity to communicate with banks even after official working hours. This way, they can have their concerns dealt with round the clock.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>4. Highly personalised customer service through data analysis</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Financial institutions have always been committed to serving their customers in the best possible ways. However, the constantly evolving market conditions and alteration in customers'' expectations have consistently warranted a change in service approach.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Before the fintech sector emerged, it was a big challenge to gain real-time insights into the evolving customer needs. Today, through customer data analysis, financial institutions gain updated information regarding the current needs of their customers.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Data generated by financial tools such as credit scores have largely helped more fintech organisations to know their customers better. For that reason, they can customise their services to fit peculiar customer needs and gain more customer attention in the long run.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>5. Segmentation for better targeting</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Market segmentation remains an important activity for improving marketing effectiveness for organisations. Trying to focus on every customer in the market weakens the strategic focus of an institution.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>On the flip side, segmenting existing and prospective customers into groups based on their shared features helps streamline and improve marketing efforts.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Fintech plays a vital role in data generation. Customers'' demographic data such as age, gender, income level, and marital status can help make communication strategies more targeted.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>A clear picture of customer groups enables financial institutions to serve their consumers the right content. Consequently, customers are no longer confused by a stream of irrelevant information, now they get content related to their needs.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>6. Wide cloud adaptation for increased security and access</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>The need for security remains a top priority for customers. Nowadays, customers need to input sensitive information when making registrations or performing transactions. Customers respond to this call, but the concern for their data security remains high.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Moreover, news of system breaches and network hacking give customers more reasons to be concerned. By adopting a cloud storage system, customers now have their sensitive information secure and accessible whenever needed.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Investment in cloud infrastructure has increased across the globe, affirming its effectiveness in providing increased security and access. Customers can now give out their sensitive information with less fear of any possible breaches in the future.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Conclusion</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Fintech is doing a lot in redefining customer experience across the financial sector. That being the case, many financial institutions are beginning to leverage fintech-driven innovations.</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>By looking at the strategies listed in this article, financial institutions and other related companies can avoid missing out on the wealth of opportunities fintech provides.</h2>', 8, 0, 1, true, '2022-04-02 11:09:43.451062 +00:00');

The iPhone SE 2022 looks practically identical to an iPhone 8 (which is a five year old design) and because of this I’ve seen some mixed reactions to the new SE by consumers.</h2><h2>Some are unimpressed when Apple doesn’t offer a completely redesigned phone, whereas others (likely the iPhone SE’s target market) are excited to be able to hang onto their favourite iPhone form-factor, with the addition of Apple’s latest hardware.</h2><h2>The iPhone SE 2022 keeps its previously seen slender, rounded form factor with a 4.7” HD Retina display that’s great for one-handed use and also makes the phone seriously pocketable.</h2><h2>Additionally, the iPhone SE has kept the home button that many iPhone users love. This offers Touch ID, which allows you to use your fingerprint to unlock your phone or to make purchases, which let’s be real, is incredibly convenient in a world where we now wear masks. The replacement for Touch ID in newer iPhones is Face ID. This is fast and convenient and will soon have support for mask-wearing, however, I personally think there’s nothing quite like a quick press of a button.</h2><p><br></p><h2><strong>Features and battery life</strong></h2><h2><br></h2><h2>Inside the iPhone SE is generously Apple’s latest A15 Bionic chip, which is the same chip inside of the iPhone 13 range. This seriously increases the processing power and speed of the SE, along with improving its battery life.</h2><h2>To see how this all fared I tested the SE’s gaming performance by playing Genshin Impact and was surprised to find it ran smoothly, even with its immersive graphics and console-quality gameplay.</h2><h2>The battery life of the phone did take a bit of a hit after an hour of gaming but for the most part the SE can last into the evening even with plenty of social media use, a couple of casual games, selfies and emails.</h2><h2>You might be surprised to find out that the phone also supports wireless charging. It can be charged on either a 3rd party Qi wireless charger or Apple’s own MagSafe chargers (it just won’t have the magnetic click because it doesn’t have MagSafe built in).</h2><h2>Additionally, the phone now has tougher glass on the back and front and is IP67 water-resistant meaning it can easily survive a splash or rain drops.</h2><p><br></p><h2><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Who is the iPhone SE for?</strong></h2><p><br></p><h2>The iPhone SE is an iPhone for under $800. It’s the cheapest iPhone you can get while still getting a quality iPhone experience with the fastest A15 Bionic chip. And if Apple’s saving money using older parts from a previous iPhone design, while the customer saves money too, is there really an issue here?</h2><h2><br></h2><h2>I think it’s the perfect iPhone for anyone who doesn’t need the extra bells and whistles, such as additional cameras, the biggest screen or the most battery life. It’s the absolute best iPhone for teenagers, who repeatedly drop their phones. And it’s even better for those who love the older design or maybe find themselves floundering when adjusting to change or an upgrade – newer iPhones use more touch gestures to navigate the device since the replacement of the home button.</h2><h2>My only additional note is that this phone has a fairly small screen, which might make the keyboard feel a little small for some.</h2><p><br></p><h2><strong>Is the iPhone SE worth the price?</strong></h2><p><br></p><h2>The base model iPhone SE starts at $719 and though this is an extremely appealing price tag this model only comes with 64GB of internal storage. It’s a bit disappointing as, in my opinion, this isn’t much storage at all – especially if you take a ton of photos and videos.</h2><h2>I would personally recommend purchasing the $799 iPhone SE which has 128GB of built in storage. There’s also an iPhone SE with 256GB of internal storage, however, it costs $969 and at this price I’d be tempted to recommend an iPhone 13, although it’s an extra few hundred dollars.</h2><h2>At the end of the day though, if you’re not fussy and like a durable and easily pocketable phone, the iPhone SE is a worthwhile purchase on a budget and not something to be written off.</h2>', 0, 0, 0, true, '2022-04-02 11:23:11.524439 +00:00');

If you didn’t catch it the first time, way back when, you certainly saw it the second time. You definitely know the meme. The set-up: An evil mastermind has donned a Spider-Man costume before committing a robbery, so the superhero will get blamed for the crime. Then the real webslinger shows up. The two masked men point at each other. They call each other impostors. Everyone’s confused: There’s more than one of them? Which one is the bad guy? Will the real Spider-Man please stand up?!</h2><p><br></p><h2>The bit dates back to a 1967 cartoon. It gets referenced as a post-credits punchline in Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, and has become a visual shorthand for everything from police fails to hip-hop beefs to Congressional stalemates. And somewhere out there, a light bulb appeared over someone’s head: What if we essentially made what was once a deep-cut in-joke for Spider-fans into a whole live-action movie?</h2><h2>By now, you have likely seen Spider-Man: No Way Home, and are aware of the secrets and surprises that await audiences, and why we’re bringing up the now-iconic Pointing Spideys image. If you have not seen the movie, or are allergic to spoilers, or simply want to remain in the dark (something Spider-Man has been known to turn off) regarding some key twists and turns, don’t proceed any further. Spoilers ahead! Klaxon GIF! Sound of sirens and the Family Feud “wrong answer” noise! Go read our Guillermo del Toro profile or our recent Adele cover story instead.</h2><p><br></p><h2>The big revelation, one denied by most of the movie’s cast for years while also being primed by the teased appearances of familiar villains, is that this is not a Spider-Man story so much as a Spider-Men one. There is not simply one webslinger in attendance here. There are not even just two. You get all three of the actors who have starred in Spider-Man movies over the past 20 years, together again for the very first time. How this happens is one of the more ridiculous aspects of No Way Home, a plot turn which involves secret identities being exposed, a kid borrowing a magical ring, and Peter Parker asking the Master of the Mystical Arts to completely alter the fabric of space and time because his friends can’t get into M.I.T. (The real answer, of course, is multicorporate synergy, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.) Yet the end result of all of this narrative backbending and the abundance of blast-from-the-past bad guys is the glorious sight of Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire standing there, a fraternity of commiserating and complementary cinematic webslingers. As we said in our review, why service just one generation of fans when you can service several at once?</h2><p><br></p><h2>None of this should have been a shock, not really. When Tom Holland’s Spider-Man showed up briefly in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, the stage was set for a studio-to-studio networking deal: You can have Spider-Man in your movies, says Sony, who’ve owned the rights to the character for decades, if we get a few crossovers for our in-house franchise. Maybe Iron Man shows up in their film. Maybe Disney gets what is arguably Marvel’s most popular superhero to swing around in their MCU. Maybe the Mouse House simply made an offer that the other company couldn’t refuse. Regardless, a portal was opened that allowed the character to skip from one cinematic universe to the next.</h2><p><br></p><h2>As for the multiverse concept — a framework that’s going to be getting a lot of screen time for a host of different I.P.s in the near future — Sony’s animated division had already given us 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse and demonstrated how wild, and wildly entertaining, arachnid heroes from lots of different friendly neighborhoods could be. The overarching narrative of Marvel’s upcoming phase is predicated on dimensions colliding into each other; the next Doctor Strange movie is subtitled “in the Multiverse of Madness.” (Kudos to No Way Home for partially dispensing with the pretense of a second post-credit teaser and simply running a mini-trailer of this next Strange outing. Treat these things like what they are.)</h2><p><br></p><h2>And then there’s the notion of those old-school supervillains showing up in trailers and character posters, confirming that all timeline- or reboot-respective Spider-era bets were off. Of course actors would coyly skirt around the question when asked, or outright deny it. Of course Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire (well, maybe not Maguire) would come back one last time, whether for a victory lap or simply a payday, in addition to Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe and Jamie Foxx. Of course when a time-hole is opened, and some Spider-Man walks through it, and removes his mask and oh my god it’s actually Garfield, people will scream. Of course when it happens a second time and yup, holy shit, there’s Spidey 1.0 himself, audiences will lose their freaking minds. (This is actual footage from the first press screening in New York.) And of course, when they find Holland, lamenting what hell he hath wrought, and suddenly you have the complete Spider-trio, sharing the screen and comparing notes…there’s going to be a current of energy rippling through whatever multiplex you’re in, even if it’s just a conversation in which older guys in spandex bitch about webswinging-related back pains.</h2><p><br></p><h2>It’s in this last third where No Way Home truly transforms itself into something unusual and a cut above your average superhero movie. For an hour and change, we’ve been watching scenes that could have been plucked from any other Holland-era entry, along with the requisite MCU drop-ins and the reminder that, while it’s great see certain actors chew acres of scenery again, not all of those first- and second-edition supervillains were created equal. Even with Molina, Dafoe, et al. mixing it up with Gen-Z Spidey, there’s still the feeling that you’re in the middle of yet another MCU movie, once again pitched at level somewhere between never-ending saga and soap opera.</h2><p><br></p><h2>But once these three get to interact and the film turns into one part Spider-group therapy session and one part buddy comedy, No Way Home levels up. There’s the odd, almost absurdist sense of fan fiction being writ large in witnessing this peck of Peters counseling each other over tragedies, joking with each other about web-shooter issues. Everyone has been singling out Garfield’s performance here, with folks saying that his aborted trilogy never really gave him the chance to carve out his take on the character. The emotional beats the movie gives him does feel like the franchise is paying penance; even if you have no dog in this fight, it’s hard not to see the look on the actor’s face when his Parker saves a falling MJ and feel as if he’s somehow dulled the pain of this for second.</h2>', 14, 0, 2, true, '2022-04-02 11:12:30.372170 +00:00');
